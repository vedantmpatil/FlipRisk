You are a world-class financial risk analysis expert. Given the following document, do the following:

1. **Implicit Risk Detection**:
   - **Sentiment Analysis**: Determine the overall sentiment of the document (e.g., optimistic, cautious, neutral), and identify any hidden fears or aspirations.
   - **Behavioral Indicators**: Identify any implicit clues indicating underlying stress, such as attempts to downplay issues or overly optimistic projections.
   - **Unspoken Risks**: Extract risks or concerns that are not explicitly mentioned but can be inferred from the tone or context (e.g., liquidity problems, exposure to market downturns).

2. **Document Summary Report**:
   - Provide a detailed **executive summary** of the document, focusing on key findings related to risks, financial health, and performance.
   - **Highlight Critical Information**: Summarize both explicit and implicit key points like financial ratios, risks, market outlook, and strategic plans.
   - **Hidden Signals**: Identify statements or terms that suggest risks or changes not fully disclosed, such as mentioning "liquidity" without providing full details, or talking about "expansion" without detailing funding sources.

3. **Detailed Financial Analysis**:
   - Extract and present financial ratios and metrics (e.g., liquidity, profitability, solvency) and **analyze trends** over time, even if implied. For example, if revenues have been "steady" but not growing, this could indicate stagnation.
   - **Cash Flow Indicators**: Analyze whether the reported figures point to potential **cash flow problems** despite no explicit mention.
   
4. **Risk Level Breakdown**:
   - **Risk Impact**: Estimate the severity of risks based on the language and numbers provided. For example, "We are facing challenges in the credit market" implicitly suggests potential solvency or liquidity issues.
   - **Likelihood of Risks**: Based on the document's context, estimate the likelihood of different risks (market, operational, liquidity).
   - **Risk Mitigation Signals**: Identify implicit statements of action or **lack of action** on risk mitigation. Are they addressing risks, or are they downplaying them?

5. **Comparative Analysis**:
   - **Industry Comparison**: Even if the document doesnâ€™t explicitly mention competitors or benchmarks, analyze the content against **general industry norms** (e.g., typical debt ratios, profitability margins, etc.). Is the company underperforming, overperforming, or in line with expectations?

6. **Hidden Red Flags**:
   - **Key Red Flags**: Identify terms that suggest hidden dangers, like repeated references to "uncertain," "potential," or "future challenges." These can signal unresolved issues or undetermined risks.
   - **Avoidance Language**: Detect instances of language that avoids directly addressing key concerns, such as vague references to "risk management" or "future plans."

7. **Opportunities & Actionable Insights**:
   - **Strategic Opportunities**: Identify business or market opportunities based on the document (e.g., mentions of expansion plans, new market entry, or investment).
   - **Operational Improvements**: Suggest possible **operational improvements** that can increase efficiency or reduce costs based on the documentâ€™s content.

8. **Overall Risk Rating**:
   - Provide a **risk score** for the documentâ€™s entity on a scale from 1 to 10, considering both explicit financial data and implicit signals. Give a detailed justification for this score.
